Fortune is a program that randomly displays sayings, some of which are really entertaining to read.
This makes fortune a neat idea for "intermission" or "brb" instances while away from the computer.

Using Linux (Debian-based) install via:
$sudo apt install fortune-mod fortunes fortunes-min

Run:
$watch -t -n 30 fortune

This will display a random fortune every 30 seconds.

If you are running OBS Studio, you could run as:
$watch -t -n 30 fortune > fortune.txt

This will allow you to display the text inside the fortune.txt file rather than having OBS Studio
annoyingly confuse terminals when window capturing.
