1. Grab your 0Auth token from here: http://www.twitchapps.com/tmi
2. Open the file ~/.irssi/config and add the following:
        {
          address = "irc.chat.twitch.tv";
          chatnet = "Twitch";
          port = "6697";
          use_ssl = "yes";
          ssl_verify = "yes";
          password = "oauth:##############################"
        }
        
    * Replace "oath:###..." with your token.
    * Most guides say Twitch IRC doesn't support ssl, but that's not true.

3. Join by opening irssi in a terminal and type:
       1. /connect Twitch
       2. /join #channelname
       3. /bye to quit irssi
    
4. Because OBS doesn't have native support displaying simple web content for Linux,
   you may want to log Twitch's IRC and then use OBS Studio's display text file content
   instead. However, I recommend removing timestamps for more annonymity:
       1. Open irssi
       2. /set autolog ON
       3. /set autolog_path ~/irclogs/%Y/$tag/$0.%m-%d.txt
       3. /set log_timestamp
           * To change back to default use /set log_timestamp = %H:%M
           
   You should now see a fold that will log all your IRC chats but without timestamps
   inside a newly created "irclogs" folder inside of $HOME. Logs are as /Year/Node/#channel.mm-dd.txt.
   You want to be sure to use "txt" instead of "log" because OBS Studio will not take it otherwise.
