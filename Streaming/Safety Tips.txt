This is more about Streaming safety, security, and Firewall related for Linux
for live streaming to services such as Twitch, YouTube, Picarto, etc.

#####[Block ICMP Request]#####
Doing so prevents your system from being "pingable."
The ICMP protocol facilitates the use of important administrator utilities such as ping and traceroute, 
but it can also be manipulated by hackers to get a snapshot of your network.
Information can be embedded inside of ICMP packets.

In a terminal:

$iptables -A INPUT --proto icmp -j DROP
$echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
$echo "net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
$sysctl -p

If you have UFW installed, add to [/etc/ufw/before.rules]:
    -A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP
    
#####[UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)]#####
$sudo ufw default deny incoming
$sudo ufw default allow outgoing

#####[SSH]#####
If you must use SSH, do the following to better protect yourself:
    $sudo ufw limit ssh
    
[/etc/host.allow]
    ALL: localhost
    sshd: hostname.local
    
[/etc/host.deny]
    ALL: PARANOID
    ALL EXCEPT in.fingerd: hostname.local
    
* Many examples of SSH security show people using IP addresses, but those are generally not permanent,
  so hostname.local makes more sense to use instead. However, I highly recommend disabling all SSH, VNC,
  SAMBA, remote desktop, etc. for security reasons if you are just using your Linux box as a normal desktop.
  
#####[fail2ban]#####
Whether or not you use SSH, it wouldn't hurt to install fail2ban. It's a process that runs in the background
and after so many failed attempts of remote logging into you computer, it adds their attacker's IP address
to a blacklist.

#####[Firejail]#####
This program sandboxes applications you may not trust to run like you do others, limiting a program's file access.
https://www.linux.com/learn/lock-your-untrusted-applications-firejail

#####[Malware and Rootkit scanning]#####
If you're running Linux, this usually isn't much of a concern, but it never hurts to take precautions.
If nothing else, don't be a virus "carrier" if you share files with Windows users.
What you want are two programs called "clamav" and "lynis."
    
#####[Conky]#####
* Disable all time, date, and weather info. You don't need it and it'll only help give your location away.
* Only run song playing, RAM, & CPU % info at the most if you must have conky.

#####[Panel]#####
* Remove time, date, and weather applets/widget
* Make sure your username is the same as your stream username

#####[Files and Folders]#####
* Make sure your /home folder name is the same as your stream username
* You should create a separate username for streaming and leave the other
  one for private stuff.
* If you do separate usernames, try not to be tempted to "ln -s" things between them, because you will break something.

#####[IRC]#####
* Twitch supports IRC, which means you may be tempted to use a program such as irssi or hexchat to display the chat in
  your stream. You should disable timestamps, if you can, to avoid timezone info.
  
#####[Biometrics]#####
* You're not going to like this, but:
    1. Never show your face
    2. Never use your voice
    3. Don't give out your real name, even to the stream service
    4. Do not tell your real-life friends about your stream
    5. Do not leave your hands on sensitive mouse while thinking
    6. Avoid giving out system information, even though you want to "show-off"
    7. Do not use drawing tablets to write anything beyond a username signature on artwork
    8. Do not stream yourself logging into any website
    9. Do not talk about where you're from or currently streaming
    10. Do not mention your gender
    11. Do not mention your age
    12. If you are going to talk about hobbies, keep them stereotypical to your "brand" as much as possible
    13. Do not mention mental or physical health
    14. Do not mention family members; only say you "have a friend"
    15. Do not mention financial or college related issues
    16. Avoid politics
    17. Avoid religion
    
* Let me give you a hypothetical (no people mentioned are real):
    TheOuterWindows (who's a moron, obviously) decides to stream to Twitch one day. This person fires up OBS Studio on
    Windows 10 because they want to stream WSL, a Linux "emulator," to run something he/she should be doing on a dedicated 
    Linux system. He/she uses their tablet's Twitch app to monitor the stream, which after ~20 seconds of starting shows it 
    to be a Caucasian female in her early 20s, blonde, cat-styled eyeliner, glasses, pale, and looks somewhere between 
    2008 "emo" and 2016 "hipster." This young female is popularly known for her drawing on Photoshop and likes to 
    slide-show her work in a box in the lower left corner. The chat is on the right-side, but she is using a pinned IRC client 
    because she can't figure out how to use OBS's web-based stuff. IRC clients usually have timestamps by default:
    
        [21:23] <example123> Hey TheOuterWindows!
        
        #[We can now hear her voice. It has a north-western, United States accent..
        ~~"Hi everyone. Just deciding to stream some Linux stuff today.
        I'm trying out this WSL thing because I can't figure out how to dual-boot and when I do, Windows updates and it breaks 
        every time. It's super convenient."~~]
                                  
        [21:30] <profanityguy69> The nasty things I would do to you...mmm.. ;)
        [21:31] <example123> @profanityguy69 She has a boyfriend. Calm down.
        [21:32] <notahacker> Why am I always cold? How's your weather?
        [21:32] <example123> Not too bad here. 5 or so degrees and light rain so far. Jamie and I roommates.
        
        #[Inferring what was just said, now known as "Jamie" says...
        ~~"Yeah, Sarah and I were thinking about going sledding if it snows, but that's hard to do in the city and the security
        guys are really anal about people out and about at night."~~]
        
        [21:34] <profanityguy69> Jamie and Sarah are pretty names. College students?
        [21:35] <example123> Yep. Roommates for two years now.
        [21:35] <example123> Gotta go Jamie. You know how coach is about phones during games...
        
        #[Now we know "Jamie" plays sports...
        ~~"I know Sarah. Go score some points! Go team! Why did I have to get in an accident...People driving on the wrong side of
        the road... That reminds me.."~~
        #Jamie grabs an orange pill bottle with a white label. She takes one and sits barely off camera, revealing,:
          ..illinian
          ..ice daily
          while also revealing what looks like a blue sports banner on the wall behind her.]
          
        [21:40] <notahacker> Is your boyfriend a streamer too?
        [21:41] <profanityguy69> Boooooooo!
        
        ~~"Yes. He's playing Pokemon right now. Channel is pkm9000"~~
        #[While she explains what he streams, Jamie opens her file browser to reveal the username: JMcMillian.]
        #[You, out of curiosity, check out pkm9000's stream, revealing a young male with a British accent.]
        #[Two hours later, you can hear a person come into the room with a bunch of stuff and saying "We won."]
        
* Can you guess who and where TheOuterWindows is?
    1. White Caucasian female --> Appearance and voice
    2. 20 year old sophomore/junior --> "Yep. Roommates for two years now." Two years + average age of 18 as a freshman = 20.
    3. Plays sports at a college with a blue banner; it could be supporting another team, but not likely.
    4. Pill bottle and computer files confirm full name as "Jamie McMillian"
    5. Boyfriend has a British accent
    6. Weather at time of [21:32] is 5 degrees Celsius, not Fahrenheit because of Jamie saying "if it snows," and light rain.
    7. Based on the size of the room and item placement, combined with the audio of a person entering the room, Jamie
       and Sarah are in a dorm.
    
    Answer: TheOuterWindows is Jamie McMillian, an American student at Oxford University, living on campus. We know she plays sports 
            and therefore would be even less likely to confuse her with another Jamie. Sports players tend to all live in the same
            dorm and so we can more easily guess which one. Dorm rooms usually have name tags on them. The weather of Oxford at 21:32
            on March 10, 2018 was about 5 degrees Celsius. Some idiots even put !weather commands in their mod bots.
            
* Hindsight:
    All Jamie had to have done was not use her looks and voice to attract views like so many female streamers do, especially the IRL ones.
    I used a college student in my example because many streamers are college students. Some of of you may say, "What about the IP address?
    Does hiding myself like a crazy person really matter?" If you are like Jamie, it still matters. This is because most colleges 
    do not use passwords but registered MAC addresses to decide who connects to their Internet. And, when you do a LAN scan at most schools,
    the IP addresses are not segregated within each router. Meaning, a LAN scan goes through 192.168.X.X, aka 255*255 = 65,025 possible
    address over the entire school Internet and even then, there still may be a few buildings Jamie could be in that are separated from this
    because perhaps the dorm is older and hasn't been upgraded yet. The only issue with this is that Jamie is in the UK, notorious for passing
    Internet surveillance legislation in the name of "protecting citizens" with no valid proof, so she may be screwed if someone really wanted 
    to go that far. 
    
    Another thing to note is phones. Most people use their real name when they setup their devices. The problem with this is
    that the name you tell it also becomes the hostname of that device. So, as long as a person has the same Internet access as you, a LAN scan
    can tell a person whether or not you're in the building if the results show something like "JMcMillian." I only mentioning this because
    some people also stream using mobile devices. Most aren't rooted, and the best thing you can do is use a trusted VPN.
    
    So for now, let's do that ICMP/Firewall/Common-sense thing and Happy Streaming!
