This is more about Streaming safety, security, and Firewall related for Linux
when live streaming to services such as Twitch, YouTube, Picarto, etc. This is
mainly focused on your computer and not the actual online accounts themselves.

#####[Block ICMP Request]#####
Doing so prevents your system from being "pingable."
The ICMP protocol facilitates the use of important administrator utilities such as ping and traceroute, 
but it can also be manipulated by hackers to get a snapshot of your network.
Information can be embedded inside of ICMP packets.

In a terminal:

$iptables -A INPUT --proto icmp -j DROP
$echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all
$echo "net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
$sysctl -p

If you have UFW installed, add to [/etc/ufw/before.rules]:
    -A ufw-before-input -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP
    
#####[Disable ipv6]#####
ipv4 accupies most of the Internet traffic; hardley anyone actually uses ipv6 but is available on
most systems as "automatic" by default. Many sources believe that ipv6 is terrible for security
and privacy. ipv6 by default incorporates hardware MAC address and even some VPN's use ipv6
for whatever reason which makes it just about useless. Matter of fact, if a website tries to get
you to use ipv6, when you purchase a product for example, your real identity from the card and
the computer you used to purchase the product are now linked because most websites and services,
Twitch/YouTube/Picarto/etc., record that information if it can get it. Please also see the
[Spoof Ethernet Mac Address] section further below.

WARNING: If you use SSH, you may get X11 forwarding errors.

Edit the file /etc/sysctl.conf
Add:
    #IPV6 disabled
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
Run:
$sudo sysctl -p
    *The contents of /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6 should change from a "0" to a
     "1"; if not, keep going anyway...
    
Open NetWorkManager (most Linux systems use it):
    Edit connections...--> Click on internface and Edit ---> IPV6 Settings ---> Method: Ignore
    
Disable on the kernel level:
echo 'blacklist ipv6' | sudo tee -a '/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.local' >/dev/null

Prevent at boot by editing GRUB:
$sudo nano /etc/default/grub

Find the line that contains "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT":
Example: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

Add "ipv6.disable=1" to the boot option, then save your grub file:
Example: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1 quiet splash"

Finally, update grub:
$sudo update-grub

Reboot and test if available with; will be blank if disabled:
$test -f /proc/net/if_inet6 && echo "Running kernel is IPv6 ready"


#####[UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)]#####
$sudo ufw default deny incoming
$sudo ufw default allow outgoing

#####[Spoof Ethernet Mac Address]#####
If you are like many Linux users, you have NetworkManager installed. You are also more than likely using
an Ethernet connection for the stream. Spoofing your MAC address is much the same as changing a web 
browser's user-agent but on a hardware level. This is important because nearly all websites record a
person's hardware MAC address if they can get it. That means even if you "John Doe" an account and then
later become partner and have to give the service your real information, that hardware's MAC address
is now forever on their servers associated with your real identity.

To randomly spoof your Ethernet Mac address:
Edit connections... --> Choose the interface and Edit--> Ethernet tab --> Cloned Mac address --> Random.

If you cannot do it this way, try to install and use a program called "macchanger."
During the install, it will ask you if you would like your MAC address changed automatically
each time an interface (Ethernet/WiFi) is up and running just like the method above will.

#####[Turn on address verification]#####
Source address verification is a kernel-level feature that drops packets pretending to come from your network. 
It uses the reverse path filter method to check whether the source of the received packet is reachable through 
the interface it came in. This may actually be on by default, but doesn't hurt to check anyway.

$echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/default/rp_filter

#####[SSH]#####
If you must use SSH, do the following to better protect yourself:
    $sudo ufw limit ssh
    
[/etc/host.allow]
    ALL: localhost
    sshd: hostname.local
    
[/etc/host.deny]
    ALL: PARANOID
    ALL EXCEPT in.fingerd: hostname.local
    
* Many examples of SSH security show people using IP addresses, but those are generally not permanent,
  so hostname.local makes more sense to use instead. However, I highly recommend disabling all SSH, VNC,
  SAMBA, remote desktop, etc. for security reasons if you are just using your Linux box as a normal desktop.
  
####[Wake On LAN]#####
Wake On LAN allows supported computers to be woken from suspension via SSH. If you are a "streamer," you
will probably be using a desktop and therefore I more than likely to suspend your computer than to actually
turn it off and unplug the Ethernet cable like you should.

To check status:
$sudo ethtool eth0 | grep Wake

To disable:
$sudo ethtool -s eth0 wol d
  
#####[fail2ban]#####
Whether or not you use SSH, it wouldn't hurt to install fail2ban. It's a process that runs in the background
and after so many failed attempts of remote logging into you computer, it adds their attacker's IP address
to a blacklist.
https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

#####[Firejail]#####
This program sandboxes applications you may not trust to run like you do others, limiting a program's file access.
https://www.linux.com/learn/lock-your-untrusted-applications-firejail

#####[Malware and Rootkit scanning]#####
If you're running Linux, this usually isn't much of a concern, but it never hurts to take precautions.
If nothing else, don't be a virus "carrier" if you share files with Windows users.
What you want are two programs called "clamav" and "lynis." Read the man pages for "clamscan," "freshclam,"
and "lynis" for help.
    
#####[Conky]#####
* Disable all time, date, and weather info. You don't need it and it'll only help give your location away.
* Only run song playing, RAM, & CPU % info at the most if you must have conky.

#####[Panel]#####
* Remove time, date, and weather applets/widget
* Make sure your username is the same as your stream username

#####[Files and Folders]#####
* Make sure your /home folder name is the same as your stream username
* You should create a separate username for streaming and leave the other
  one for private stuff.
* If you do separate usernames, try not to be tempted to "ln -s" things between them, because you will break something.

#####[IRC]#####
* Twitch supports IRC, which means you may be tempted to use a program such as irssi or hexchat to display the chat in
  your stream. You should disable timestamps, if you can, to avoid timezone info.
  
#####[Biometrics]#####
* You're not going to like this, but:
    1. Never show your face.
    2. Never use your voice.
    3. Don't give out your real name, even to the stream service.
    4. Do not tell your real-life friends about your stream.
    5. Do not leave your hands on a mouse while thinking; you may do something stupid by accident.
    6. Avoid giving out system information, even though you want to "show-off."
    7. Do not use drawing tablets to write anything beyond a username signature on artwork.
    8. Do not stream yourself logging into any website.
    9. Do not talk about where you're from or currently streaming.
    10. Do not mention your gender.
    11. Do not mention your age.
    12. If you are going to talk about hobbies, keep them stereotypical to your "brand" as much as possible.
    13. Do not mention mental or physical health.
    14. Do not mention family members; only say you "have a friend."
    15. Do not mention financial or college related issues.
    16. Avoid politics.
    17. Avoid religion.
    
* Let me give you a hypothetical (no people mentioned are real):
    TheOuterWindows (who's a moron, obviously) decides to stream to Twitch one day. This person fires up OBS Studio on
    Windows 10 because they want to stream WSL, a Linux "emulator," to run something he/she should be doing on a dedicated 
    Linux system. He/she uses their tablet's Twitch app to monitor the stream, which after ~20 seconds of starting shows it 
    to be a Caucasian female in her early 20s, blonde, cat-styled eyeliner, glasses, pale, and looks somewhere between 
    2008 "emo" and 2016 "hipster." This young female is popularly known for her drawing on Photoshop and likes to 
    slide-show her work in a box in the lower left corner. The chat is on the right-side, but she is using a pinned IRC client 
    because she can't figure out how to use OBS's web-based stuff. IRC clients usually have timestamps by default:
    
        [21:23] <example123> Hey TheOuterWindows!
        
        #[We can now hear her voice. It has a north-western, United States accent..
        ~~"Hi everyone. Just deciding to stream some Linux stuff today.
        I'm trying out this WSL thing because I can't figure out how to dual-boot and when I do, Windows updates and it breaks 
        every time. It's super convenient."~~]
                                  
        [21:30] <profanityguy69> The nasty things I would do to you...mmm.. ;)
        [21:31] <example123> @profanityguy69 She has a boyfriend. Calm down.
        [21:32] <notahacker> Why am I always cold? How's your weather?
        [21:32] <example123> Not too bad here. 5 or so degrees and light rain so far. Jamie and I roommates.
        
        #[Inferring what was just said, now known as "Jamie" says...
        ~~"Yeah, Sarah and I were thinking about going sledding if it snows, but that's hard to do in the city and the security
        guys are really anal about people out and about at night."~~]
        
        [21:34] <profanityguy69> Jamie and Sarah are pretty names. College students?
        [21:35] <example123> Yep. Roommates for two years now.
        [21:35] <example123> Gotta go Jamie. You know how coach is about phones during games...
        
        #[Now we know "Jamie" plays sports...
        ~~"I know Sarah. Go score some points! Go team! Why did I have to get in an accident...People driving on the wrong side of
        the road... That reminds me.."~~
        #Jamie grabs an orange pill bottle with a white label. She takes one and sits barely off camera, revealing,:
          ..illinian
          ..ice daily
          while also revealing what looks like a blue sports banner on the wall behind her.]
          
        [21:40] <notahacker> Is your boyfriend a streamer too?
        [21:41] <profanityguy69> Boooooooo!
        
        ~~"Yes. He's playing Pokemon right now. Channel is pkm9000"~~
        #[While she explains what he streams, Jamie opens her file browser to reveal the username: JMcMillian.]
        #[You, out of curiosity, check out pkm9000's stream, revealing a young male with a British accent.]
        #[Two hours later, you can hear a person come into the room with a bunch of stuff and saying "We won."]
        
* Can you guess who and where TheOuterWindows is?
    1. White Caucasian female --> Appearance and voice
    2. 20 year old sophomore/junior --> "Yep. Roommates for two years now." Two years + average age of 18 as a freshman = 20.
    3. Plays sports at a college with a blue banner; it could be supporting another team, but not likely.
    4. Pill bottle and computer files confirm full name as "Jamie McMillian"
    5. Boyfriend has a British accent
    6. Weather at time of [21:32] is 5 degrees Celsius, not Fahrenheit because of Jamie saying "if it snows," and light rain.
    7. Based on the size of the room and item placement, combined with the audio of a person entering the room, Jamie
       and Sarah are in a dorm.
    
    Answer: TheOuterWindows is Jamie McMillian, an American student at Oxford University, living on campus. We know she plays sports 
            and therefore would be even less likely to confuse her with another Jamie. Sports players tend to all live in the same
            dorm and so we can more easily guess which one. Dorm rooms usually have name tags on them. The weather of Oxford at 21:32
            on March 10, 2018 was about 5 degrees Celsius. Some idiots even put !weather commands in their mod bots.
            
* Hindsight:
    All Jamie had to have done was not use her looks and voice to attract views like so many female streamers do, especially the IRL ones.
    I used a college student in my example because many streamers are college students. Some of of you may say, "What about the IP address?
    Does hiding myself like a crazy person really matter?" If you are like Jamie, it still matters. This is because most colleges 
    do not use passwords but registered MAC addresses to decide who connects to their Internet. And, when you do a LAN scan at most schools,
    the IP addresses are not segregated within each router. Meaning, a LAN scan goes through 192.168.X.X, aka 255*255 = 65,025 possible
    address over the entire school Internet and even then, there still may be a few buildings Jamie could be in that are separated from this
    because perhaps the dorm is older and hasn't been upgraded yet. The only issue with this is that Jamie is in the UK, notorious for passing
    Internet surveillance legislation in the name of "protecting citizens" with no valid proof, so she may be screwed if someone really wanted 
    to go that far. 
    
    Another thing to note is phones. Most people use their real name when they setup their devices. The problem with this is
    that the name you tell it also becomes the hostname of that device. So, as long as a person has the same Internet access as you, a LAN scan
    can tell a person whether or not you're in the building if the results show something like "JMcMillian." I only mentioning this because
    some people also stream using mobile devices. Most aren't rooted, and the best thing you can do is use a trusted VPN.
    
    So for now, let's do that ICMP/Firewall/Common-sense thing and Happy Streaming!
